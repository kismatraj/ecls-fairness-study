    "description": "This software conducts a comprehensive, multi-dimensional fairness audit of machine learning models trained on early childhood data (kindergarten through 2nd grade) to predict 5th-grade academic risk using the ECLS-K:2011 nationally representative longitudinal study (N = 9,104). It evaluates seven ML algorithms across group fairness with bootstrap confidence intervals, calibration fairness, and intersectional (race x SES) analysis, revealing significant disparities including systematic under-identification of minority students and threshold-dependent fairness compliance. The codebase includes SHAP-based explainability, temporal generalization analysis across four developmental windows, sensitivity analysis, and post-hoc bias mitigation via threshold optimization.",
